# BBAnimConverter
A tool that converts Bloodborne's PS4 animations to HavokTools-friendly files


## Tool Description
The hkx animation files of Bloodborne cannot be opened directly with Havok's Tools, and that's because they are formatted for PS4 use. This tool fixes these animations so that they can be previewed in Havok's Tools.


### Usage

Run the program, and Choose the folder you have the HKX files in (The program creates a folder called "Place_HKX_Here", which you can place your files there as well). The result files will be in the "Output" folder created in the same folder the HKX files are in.
The files can be opened now with Havok Tools 2014 64-bit.
You need to load both the Skeleton.hkx and the animation file together to preview.
