# BBAnimConverter
A tool that converts Bloodborne's PS4 animations to HavokTools-friendly files


## Tool Description
The hkx animation files of Bloodborne cannot be opened directly with Havok's Tools, and that's because they are formatted for PS4 use. This tool fixes these animations so that they can be previewed in Havok's Tools.


### Usage

Place the .hkx files in the IN folder, and launch the program. The converted .hkx files will be in the OUT folder.
The files can be opened now with Havok Tools 2014 64-bit. You need to load both the Skeleton.hkx and the animation file together to preview.
